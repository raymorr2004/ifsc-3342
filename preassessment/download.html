    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey Thomas!-->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>the &quot;alt&quot; attribute provides alternative text for an image, describing what the image is and the content of the image. This is used for accessibility and as a fallback if the image doesn't load.</p>
    <p>the title attribute provides extra information for an element, allowing for that information to show up to the user when they hover their mouse over the element. It is not tied to accessibility so much as the &quot;alt&quot; attribute is.</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <div id="definitionanswer">
    <blockquote>
      <p>Meme: <q>an amusing or interesting item (such as a captioned picture or video) or genre of items that is spread widely online especially through social media</q> <cite>Source: Merriam-Webster</cite></p>
  <p>Responsive Design: <q>a web design approach to make web pages render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good usability.</q> <cite>Source: Mozilla Web Docs</cite></p>
