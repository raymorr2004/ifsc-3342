        <h5>Who is the target audience?</h5>
        <p>My target audience is primarily my Twitch viewers, fans, and followers from platforms like Instagram,
            TikTok, Discord, and Reddit. I'm also aiming to reach new potential viewers who are interested in gaming,
            streaming, or my personality and content style.</p>
        
        <h5>How can I tailor the web site to reach that audience?</h5>
        <p>I'm designing the site with a soft, cute aesthetic that reflects my personal brand and stream vibe.
            I'm making sure it's mobile-friendly, visually engaging, and easy to navigate.
            Everything important—like my socials, stream info, and content—is just a click away, so people can connect with me wherever they prefer.</p>
        
        <h5>What are the goals for the site?</h5>
        <p>My main goals are to create a central hub where people can access all my content and platforms,
            learn more about who I am, and get involved with my community. I also want it to act like a digital portfolio that
            represents me as a creator and streamer.</p>
        
        <h5>How will I gather the information?</h5>
        <p>I'm pulling content directly from my own platforms—like Twitch, Instagram, Discord, and Reddit—
            as well as using personal photos, stream clips, and details about my setup.
            I'll also take inspiration from other creator sites I admire.</p>
        
        <h5>What are my sources for multimedia content?</h5>
        <p>Most of the multimedia content will come from my personal collection—like images of my streaming setup,
            profile pictures, and content I've shared on my social media.
            I may also use free icon libraries or design tools to make everything visually cohesive.</p>
        
        <h5>What is my budget?</h5>
        <p>I'm keeping this project low-cost by using free tools and resources. I don't need to spend money on web hosting or a
            custom domain unless I decide to upgrade in the future. I am planning toward that direction over time.</p>
        
        <h5>How long do I have to complete the project?</h5>
        <p>I plan to complete the project within a few days,
            depending on how much time I can dedicate over the rest of the semester.
            I want to leave enough time for design, coding, feedback, and testing.</p>
        
        <h5>Who is on my project team?</h5>
        <p>It's just me! I'm designing, building, and maintaining the site myself.
            However, I may ask friends or classmates to give feedback or help test the site once I have a working version.</p>
        
        <h5>How often should the site be updated?</h5>
        <p>I want to update the site at least once a month or anytime something major changes—like my streaming schedule,
            a new game I'm playing, or a new social platform I'm using. I want to keep it fresh and relevant, while maintaining its cozy feel.</p>
        
        <h5>Who is responsible for updating the site?</h5>
        <p>I'll be handling all the updates myself. Since I'm the creator and I know my content best,
            it makes sense for me to manage it directly. I'll make sure the code is clean and organized so updates are easy.
        I am not a big creator, so I have time to manage my own updates.</p>
